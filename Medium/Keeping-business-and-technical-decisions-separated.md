# Keeping business and technical decisions separated

> _This is an article of a series covering the business decisions of Bürokratt's not so common development practices_

## Background

Until summer 2022, technical developments of Bürokratt took place hand-in-hand with the business and technical teams on a daily basis. It's the usual way of doing things - groom 1, maximum 2 sprints ahead depending on the business requirements set or changed by that time.

It's perfectly fine if you have a small amount of partners and your business requirements change a lot or are not otherwise clear by the time of publishing your procurement.

With having 25 outsourced partners and the number growing, paying by the hour, including for onboarding, re-onboarding when the team members change, etc, this really isn't an option.

## Problem to solve - fix the scope

So we had to find a way to pay a fixed sum for the agreed outcome. This means that the scope has to be fixed, there's no way around it.

And let's face it - the scope rarely changes on any other reasons than the business ones.

In summer 2022, we made an agreement within our team to not pass any of the work to the technical team (including the architect) to review until the business scope has been fixed. You might think that the logic behind it is to reduce the work load of the architect, but no. The value comes from business teams focusing on what really matters - how the product should look and feel like, not how and what it's running on.

Up to that point, we didn't even have correct user stories an acceptance criteria because there was simply no need for it - all parties were involved during the 1-2 week sprint and the task was later forgotten. 



## Scope is vague

## Can't buy results, must pay for the hours

- Only large and long-term procurements

## Architect only steps in after business has finished their work

## Business AC rarely change
