# Why BÃ¼rokratt chose the model of Open Development

## Open development vs open-source software development

First things first.

In general, **open-source software development** means that that the source code produced is publicly accessible for anyone to study, use, change, etc. Open source does not mean being being free of charge. You can read more about it from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development).

**Open development** is something not yet so well described. For instance, at the time of publishing this article, Wikipedia does not yet have a page to cover open development.

For us, open development, compared to plain simple open-source development, is a major step up regarding to transparency.

## (Almost) everything is public

You can find whatever we are currently working on from https://github.com/buerokratt. This means being completely out in the open starting from draft ideas to work in progress and final projects.

The only things we can't go public with are budgets, contracts, etc.
