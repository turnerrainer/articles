# Why Bürokratt chose the model of open development

## Open development vs open-source software development

First things first.

In general, **open-source software development** means that the source code produced is publicly accessible for anyone to study, use, change, etc. Open source does not mean being being free of charge. You can read more about it from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development).

**Open development** is something not yet so well described. For instance, at the time of publishing this article, Wikipedia does not yet have a page to cover open development.

For us, open development, compared to plain simple open-source development, is a major step forward regarding to transparency, better processes and higher quality. Open developments can, but do not have to be open-source developments, and vice versa.

## Bürokratt and open development

Bürokratt fully adopted open development in May 2022 and hasn't looked back since. Ca 6+ months later, https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/projects consists of 22 public Bürokratt projects, many of which are in status of initial thoughts, drafts, or work in process.

For us, this is one of the key aspects of open development - **being public with your draft ideas is more than okay.** Sounds simple but is rarely practiced in real life. _**Why is this important?**_

## First feedback and lessons learned

### Positive sides

**Public feedback** has definitely been positive.

Our **processes** have improved a lot. This is actually strange as we are _kind of_ doing the same things we did before but... a lot better.

The **shift in mindset** has been massive. Knowing that whatever you do, even if you change it right away, will be visible in git history until the end of times, changes what you do. And this results in **higher quality.**

There are a lot less discussions and arguments that don't create much value. All you have to do is say "let's move this discussion to GitHub" and problems seem to go away

Complete history of not just code commits but also discussions showing how we ended up with (proposed) solutions.

### Negative sides






Feedback to such development model can be divided into 4 groups.

**The ones looking at it from far** are almost entirely positive. You don't even need to go into details, it just looks and sounds awesome.

Next there is **Bürokratt team itself.** Open development has clearly changed a lot of processes and practices for us and we just love it. But not all is just roses
