# Why B端rokratt chose the model of open development

## Open development vs open-source software development

First things first.

You can read about open-source software development from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development), but at the time of publishing this article, Wikipedia does not yet have a page to cover open development. So this is kind of an uncharted territory yet.

For us, open development means being completely public regarding to pretty much everything. True, we don't publish our contracts with partners, etc, but you can find everything else from https://github.com/buerokratt.

## Adopting open development

B端rokratt fully adopted open development in May 2022 and hasn't looked back since. Ca 6+ months later, https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/projects consists of 22 public B端rokratt projects, most of which are in status of initial thoughts, drafts, or work in process. The first ever of such projects can be found from https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/projects/3.

## We are still making our first steps

We are still experimenting, looking for the best practices and fine-graining our processes, but the big picture is there. Everything starts with public draft projects, adding initial thoughts to mark the key elements of user stories and acceptance criterias to be, moving on to fine-tuning them, and then, finally, getting it done by ourselves or with a help of our partners. Everything always in public with 0 internal project management tools, code repositories, etc.

There's nothing special about the process, right? So why are you not doing it in public?

## Discrete learning is not the key

I once heard Priit Raspel, a legendary IT-guru in Estonia, saying that he asks his students not to practice discrete learning. Simple, right, but really the foundation of open development as well. If you're stuck on something, let everyone know of it so they could resolve it for you. Not to help you out as a person but by knowing that money is there to pick it up.

When you scale it up to a level of large projects, the effect is imminent. And for the business owner, this is where the value lies in - less time-consuming onboarding because of discrete learning, which, in the end, the business owner always pays for.

## Lessons learned

I guess the best way to describe the positive effects of open development is **collateral benefits.** We don't have a strict guideline to follow, except the demand to do everything publicly. Some key aspects will definitely be described at some point, but we are not there yet.

## First feedback and lessons learned

### Positive sides

**Public feedback** has definitely been positive.

Our **processes** have improved a lot. This is actually strange as we are _kind of_ doing the same things we did before but... a lot better.

The **shift in mindset** has been massive. Knowing that whatever you do, even if you change it right away, will be visible in git history until the end of times, changes what you do. And this results in **higher quality.**

There are a lot less discussions and arguments that don't create much value. All you have to do is say "let's move this discussion to GitHub" and problems seem to go away

### Negative sides






Feedback to such development model can be divided into 4 groups.

**The ones looking at it from far** are almost entirely positive. You don't even need to go into details, it just looks and sounds awesome.

Next there is **B端rokratt team itself.** Open development has clearly changed a lot of processes and practices for us and we just love it. But not all is just roses
