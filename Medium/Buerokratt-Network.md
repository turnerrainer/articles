# Why we are building Bürokratt Network
# Bürokratt Network to reduce creating duplicate gov e-services

## Where we are now

When we talk about gov e-services, Estonia has been a pioneer in it for more than 20 years. That success is based on [X-road](https://x-road.global), allowing participants to securely exchange sensitive data. For example, Bürokratt, along others, can make requests about my recipes, drivers license, family relations, etc.

There are about 3000 different X-road requests you can make. Different participants use them AS IS or combine new services based on them. Which is great, because there's no central decision-maker deciding which one is a good enough service worth creating.

## Problem to solve

But this has also led us to the problem of having a lot of gov web portals, often duplicating each other's services. Estonia takes implementing [once-only principle (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once-only_principle) seriously, but expecting to replace data duplication in all of our systems in a short time just doesn't add up.

# Bürokratt Network

In essence, Bürokratt Network is a [star network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network), kind of connecting every participant to a central hub, while making sure that interruptions within any of the participants won't result in affecting other participants. At least not technically.

## Connecting independent service providers

Business-wise, Bürokratt Network is a group of independent gov e-service providers, acting on the basis of serving each other's clients as if they were their own.

### Why is this important?

By serving each other's clients, there's no need for duplicate services. Neither to create new ones, and, in the long run, to maintain the current ones, which actually already have an owner.
